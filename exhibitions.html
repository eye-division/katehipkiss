    <p>This is a selected exhibition in the beautiful surroundings of Kendrew Barn Gallery. I'm delighted to have two layered papercuts included amongst some very high quality work.<br /><br />This <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/visit-us/">link</a> will take you to the St John's College website where, if you scroll down, you will find on the right a link to a plan of the college.<br />The entrance to the barn gallery is on the right hand side if you are heading away from Oxford on St Giles, a little further down than the war memorial where St Giles divides into Woodstock Road and Banbury Road.<br />&nbsp;</p>
