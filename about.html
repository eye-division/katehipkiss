<div class="editable">
    <p>I work with paper, cutting intricate patterns and shapes to exploit the qualities of the material and create delicate, complex layers full of movement and depth.</p>
    <p>Inspired by architecture, landscape and the natural world, I am especially interested in forms within the landscape created both by natural forces, such as flowing water, and human exploits like mining and farming; the shaping of our landscape over time and the conflict of seeking beauty in the scars of human activity on the earth.</p>
