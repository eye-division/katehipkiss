    <p>I work with paper, cutting intricate designs by hand to create delicate, complex layers.</p>
    <p>My work with maps and atlases explores individual and collective memory, the known/unknown and absence/presence. Process is central to my work and the symbiotic relationship between the thought process, the source material and the making process is increasingly significant. The slow pace of making is reflected in the objects I make and communicates a deeper time. The work bridges memory, imagination and reality as our implicit understanding of the source material is brought into focus and we question the information that remains.</p>
    <p>The layered papercuts exploit the simplicity of cut and layered paper in expressing the landscape around us.</p>
    <p>I studied Visual Arts: Drawing at Camberwell College of Arts, followed by a PGCE in Art and Design and in 2020 completed an MFA in Fine Art at Oxford Brookes University with Distinction.</p>
