    <p>I work with paper, cutting intricate designs by hand to create delicate, complex layers. There are 3 strands to my work which use this technique to create distinct visual outcomes.</p>
    <p>My work with maps and atlases explores individual and collective memory, the known/unknown and absence/presence. Process is central to my work and the symbiotic relationship between the thought process, the source material and the making process is increasingly significant. The slow pace of making is reflected in the objects I make and communicates a deeper time. The work bridges memory, imagination and reality as our implicit understanding of the source material is brought into focus and we question the information that remains.</p>
    <p>The abstract series explores pattern and colour in the landscape and natural world on a macro and micro level. Satellite imagery reveals beautiful colours and pattern in the landscape, both natural and man-made, and micro images of plants and natural objects often reveal surprisingly similar structures. I am especially interested in marks on the landscape created by natural forces such as flowing water, or scars created by human activities such as mining and farming; the shaping of our landscape over time.</p>
    <p>The architectural series explores structure and light, which is echoed in my choice of materials. By exploiting the qualities of cut and layered paper, the fall of light becomes central to the work and helps define the image.</p>
    <p>I studied fine art at Camberwell College of Arts, followed by a PGCE in Art and Design and in 2020 completed an MFA in Fine Art at Oxford Brookes University with Distinction.</p>
