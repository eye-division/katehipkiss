  The Geological series explores pattern and colour in the landscape and natural
  world on a macro and micro level. Satellite imagery reveals beautiful colours
  and pattern in the landscape, both natural and man-made, and micro images of
  plants and natural objects often reveal surprisingly similar structures. I am
  especially interested in marks on the landscape created by natural forces such
  as flowing water, or scars created by human activities such as mining and
  farming; the shaping of our landscape over time.
