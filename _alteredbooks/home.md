### £2,500.00<br>

‘Home’ explores what a sense of home might mean, whether it is a sense of security and comfort or, particularly over recent years, a sense of confinement. The repetition and familiarity of the house form is in contrast to the multitude of associations the idea of home can evoke; is it a place, a person, a memory or a feeling?<br><br>This sculpture can be seen in the PULP exhibition at [MAKE Southwest](https://makesouthwest.org.uk/all-activity/pulp){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} , Devon. Please contact the gallery if you are interested in purchasing it.
