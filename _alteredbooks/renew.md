### **Â£1,600.00**

Renew is one of a series of recent works addressing environmental issues through altered atlases. It focuses on the percentage energy use of 60 countries around the world that comes from renewable sources.

The concept of boxes made from cut maps is one I frequently return to as a means of exploring collective memory and experience. In Renew the boxes are not only a visual tool alluding to data but they also create a tension that comes from retaining the road networks and configuring the piece as a city in contrast to the environmental focus of the work.
