‘We Came to be Here’ reflects upon early human migration across the globe from Africa (the central globe) and our need as humans to push outwards; to grow, multiply and control, and the impact of this behaviour on the planet.

In this work 12 globes nestle one inside another; too dense to see through to the middle and too closely packed to move. Glimpses of text are like vestiges of place and memory.
