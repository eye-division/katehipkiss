### £1,050.00<br>

‘*A Way To Go’* reflects upon the significant journeys and experiences throughout our lives that continue to shape us. Some are fundamental to who we are while some remain buried within us, impacting our lives in ways we don’t readily understand.

The form of the house embodies a sense of security and comfort, which is juxtaposed by the sense of uncertainty created by the removal of information from the maps, leaving only the patterns of the roads and snippets of words visible, like vestiges of memory.

The sculpture is hand-cut from used OS maps and the residual ‘memories’ of lived experiences are an intrinsic part of this work but will remain unknown and unknowable; absent while remaining present.

**This sculpture will be exhibited in *'A Room of One's Own'* at the [Irving Gallery](https://www.irvinggallery.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, Oxford from 2nd March - 5th April 2024. Please contact myself or the gallery for further details, or if you are interested in purchasing it.**
