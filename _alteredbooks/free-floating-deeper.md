### £1250.00

Handcut pages from a book

"Time Whirls<br>Life is free-floating,<br>deeper<br>In never-ending twilight"

‘Free-Floating Deeper’ is one of a series of recent works addressing environmental issues through altered books. It focuses on our relationship with the oceans and with our wider environment.<br>By editing, redacting and obscuring while at the same time selecting, revealing and augmenting, outdated information and knowledge is reframed; re-presented.<br>I find new meaning within the text, allowing poetry to emerge which guides the reading of the work, creating a narrative and a space in which we can place ourselves.
